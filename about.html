                <h3>About Freshly Organic</h3>
                <p>
                    Most of our users ask us, why are you called Freshly Organic? We like to chuckle at that question
                    because
                    it seems so obvious to us. The freshest deals at the freshest prices. Simple as that. We were
                    founded on this belief and it helps guide every decision we make day in and day out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well there's one other reason we're called Freshly Organic: our fearless founders. We were created
                    as a
                    pop-and-pop shop in 1912 by two young entrepeneurs: Johnny Fresh and Punxutawney Deal. Since those
                    days, we've scaled to serve organic ingredients to the entire world. Though Johnny and Punx no
                    longer run Freshly Organic, we are commited to keeping their dream alive. We hope you've enjoyed
                    your
                    experiences with Freshly Organic over the past decades. We're excited to show you how much more we
                    can do
                    as we continue to grow!
                </p>
